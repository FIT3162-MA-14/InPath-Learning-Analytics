It allows students and educators to visually track, monitor, and analyse performance indicators and metrics of overall participation level for all students. It also allows comparisons to be made for each student to see where they stand in the whole cohort in terms of their interaction with the forum based on the metrics we have proposed.",

The statistics are based on the learning metrics proposed by our team which will be used to analyse the studentsâ€™ performance.

        title: "Ranking",
        text: "The Ranking page allows students to view the ranking of top active users in the online discussion forum. To motivate students to participate in the forum, we devised a badge system that will classify students into three hierarchical membership groups, which are Hall of Fame, All Star and Rookies, based on their level of participation in the forum. With reference to the article written by Cheng and Vassileva (2005), in terms of social validation, displaying the active users from the A-lister category to the students is a way to motivate students to increase their engagement with the forum.",
